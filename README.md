UI Compose Kata is a collection of coding challenges aimed at helping you master the art of UI development with Jetpack Compose. Each challenge focuses on a specific aspect of UI design and implementation, providing you with hands-on experience and opportunities to hone your skills.

## How It Works

In each challenge, you'll be presented with a UI design or requirement to implement using Jetpack Compose.
